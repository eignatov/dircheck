NOTE: Requires the package python-mysqldb to be installed

Create the database user, create the table and grant given permissions
 CREATE USER 'dircheck'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'qwerty';
 CREATE DATABASE dircheck;
 GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,CREATE,DELETE ON dircheck.* TO 'dircheck'@'localhost';

This script will automatically create the table if it doesn't exist.
If you want to set it up manually, use:
 CREATE TABLE dircheck.Files(name VARCHAR(25) PRIMARY KEY, mtime INT, flag BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true);
