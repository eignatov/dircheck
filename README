A simple, stand-alone script to reflect files and modification times in a MySQL db.
It updates the table and quits, which means it should probably be called by crontab to keep the table continously updated.

NOTE: Requires the package python-mysqldb to be installed

All settings are in the top of the actual script. You should change the default values (at least the password).

Create the database user, create the table and grant given permissions:
 CREATE USER 'dircheck'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'qwerty';
 CREATE DATABASE dircheck;
 GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,CREATE,DELETE ON dircheck.* TO 'dircheck'@'localhost';

This script will not create the table if it doesn't exist (can be changed by calling FileTable.create_table() e.g. from the FileTable constructor).
It expects the table to look something like:
 CREATE TABLE dircheck.Files(name VARCHAR(25) PRIMARY KEY, mtime INT, flag BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT true);

Crontab instructions:
Add to your personal crontab by calling "crontab -e" and setting
* * * * * /path/to/script/dircheck.py
